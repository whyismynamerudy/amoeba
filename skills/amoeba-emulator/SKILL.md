  iOS Simulator control from inside Amoeba, with the live device view in Amoeba's
  emulator pane. Use when driving a booted Apple Simulator on macOS: taps,
  gestures, typing, hardware buttons, rotation, and the accessibility tree, or
  when an iOS change needs simulator evidence. For an Android device or emulator
  use the Android emulator skill; build and install the app with xcodebuild or
  simctl first.

# Amoeba Emulator

This discovery stub loads the version-matched guide from the Amoeba executable used for this session.

Prefer Amoeba over raw `serve-sim` or direct `simctl` for simulator control inside Amoeba; it
handles device scoping, helper lifecycle, and worktree context.

## Resolve the CLI for this session

Choose the executable once and reuse it for every later command:

- If the `ORCA_CLI_COMMAND` environment variable is set, use its value. Amoeba exports this
  for managed sessions.
- Otherwise, in a dev checkout whose session exposes `ORCA_DEV_REPO_ROOT`, use `amoeba-dev`.
- Otherwise, use `amoeba`.

Below, `AMOEBA` is a placeholder for the executable you resolved. Substitute it before
running anything; do not create a shell variable or run `AMOEBA` literally. This works the
same way in POSIX shells, PowerShell, and cmd.exe.

If the selected executable cannot run, report its exact error and stop. Do not fall through
to another executable, which could silently target a different Amoeba build.

## Load the version-matched guide before running Amoeba commands

```text
AMOEBA skills get amoeba-emulator
```

Prefer `--json`. Use the selected executable's `--help` for commands or flags the guide does
not cover. If a command reports that Amoeba is not running, start it with `AMOEBA open --json`
and retry. If it fails with `runtime_access_denied`, your sandbox blocked the connection:
re-run it with escalated permissions, and do not run `AMOEBA open` or restart Amoeba. If
`skills get` is unknown, explain that updating Amoeba restores the guide; use `--help` for
read-only discovery and do not guess unsupported commands.
