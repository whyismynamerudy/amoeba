description: >-
  Drives the GUI of a visible local app window through `amoeba computer`: accessibility
  tree, clicks, typing, menus, dialogs, and screenshots in native apps and external
  browser windows (Chrome, Edge, Safari) or webviews. Prefer a programmatic path
  (shell, filesystem, git, HTTP, existing CLIs) whenever it can complete the task.
  Use only when a visible window needs GUI control those cannot reach. Do not use
  for Amoeba's embedded browser (`amoeba-cli`).

# Computer Use

This discovery stub loads the version-matched guide from the Amoeba executable used for this session.

## Resolve the CLI for this session

Choose the executable once and reuse it for every later command:

- If the `ORCA_CLI_COMMAND` environment variable is set, use its value. Amoeba exports this
  for managed sessions.
- Otherwise, in a dev checkout whose session exposes `ORCA_DEV_REPO_ROOT`, use `amoeba-dev`.
- Otherwise, use `amoeba`.

Below, `AMOEBA` is a placeholder for the executable you resolved. Substitute it before
running anything; do not create a shell variable or run `AMOEBA` literally. This works the
same way in POSIX shells, PowerShell, and cmd.exe.

If the selected executable cannot run, report its exact error and stop. Do not fall through
to another executable, which could silently target a different Amoeba build.

## Load the version-matched guide before running Amoeba commands

```text
AMOEBA skills get computer-use
```

Prefer `--json`. Use the selected executable's `--help` for commands or flags the guide does
not cover. If a command reports that Amoeba is not running, start it with `AMOEBA open --json`
and retry. If it fails with `runtime_access_denied`, your sandbox blocked the connection:
re-run it with escalated permissions, and do not run `AMOEBA open` or restart Amoeba. If
`skills get` is unknown, explain that updating Amoeba restores the guide; use `--help` for
read-only discovery and do not guess unsupported commands.
